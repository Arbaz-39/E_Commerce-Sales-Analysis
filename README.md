Objective: The aim of our project is to analyze sales data to derive insights about customer behavior, 
           sales trends, and overall business performance. By integrating SQL and Python, I've harnessed 
           the strengths of both to manipulate and visualize your data effectively.

Dataset: The dataset which I have for this project is taken from Kaggle, contains seven csv files(tables).
         (i).   Customers
         (ii).  Sellers
         (iii). Orders
         (iv).  Order_items
         (v).   Payments
         (vi).  Geoloctaions
         (vii). Products

Key Components:
Data Acquisition:
    SQL Connector: Used this library to connect to a database, enabling us to fetch sales data directly from your SQL database.
    
Data Processing:
    Pandas and NumPy: Once the data was retrieved, I have utilized Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, such as handling missing values, 
    filtering data, and reshaping datasets. NumPy likely assisted in performing numerical operations and calculations efficiently.
    
SQL Concepts Used:

    Joins:  Applied SQL joins (INNER, LEFT, etc.) to combine data from different tables, such as sales and customer information, to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

    Common Table Expressions (CTEs): CTEs helped simplify complex queries by breaking them down into more manageable parts, making it easier to read and maintain.
    
    Moving Averages: This technique is used to find the average of purchase value of each customer in each month providing a clearer view of long-term trends.
    
    Cumulative Sales: By calculating cumulative sales, we are able to analyze performance over time, identifying growth patterns and milestones.
    
    Top Customer Analysis: Identifying our top customers could reveal valuable insights into purchasing behavior and help with targeted marketing strategies.
    
Data Visualization:

    Matplotlib and Seaborn: These libraries are employed to create visualizations, such as bar charts for top customers, and heatmaps to show correlations in the data. 
    Visualization helps in making data more interpretable and insightful.
    
    Potential Findings and Insights:
    Through our analysis, you may have uncovered:

      Sales Trends: Insights into how sales fluctuate over time, helping in forecasting future performance.
      Customer Behavior: Identifying patterns in customer purchases, such as peak buying times or preferences for certain products.
      Performance Metrics: Understanding which products or services drive the most revenue and identifying the most valuable customers.
